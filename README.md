# Theif-and-theft-identification-using-CNN
The customers using the ATMs are susceptible to attacks with dangerous weapons and hence it is essential to implement a system that not only provides more safety to the customers but also helps nab the intruder easily. This project also makes it mandatory to follow the ATM usage rules that prevent access to the ATM resources while wearing a helmet or a mask. In our proposed system, we have implemented detection of criminal activity by detection of person wearing mask or by carrying lethal or non-lethal weapons with them. For detection activity, we have implemented CNN algorithm. We have trained the system by importing the images of the lethal/Non-lethal weapon and persons wearing mask. The Keras API is used to detect objects on the OpenCV and Tensor flow platform. In this project, the alert message is sent to the bank and the other required users through the g-mail to their e-mail id. It also provides security for civilians, and they can go to an ATM without fear. This proposed system helps to avoid crime and helps the law-and-enforcement officers to identify the criminals.
